# Earth

The `Earth` object provides a collection of fundamental, globally-accepted constants related to the
Earth's dimensions. These values are based on the World Geodetic System (WGS 84) ellipsoid model and
are provided in meters.

As a Kotlin `object`, it is a singleton, and its properties can be accessed directly without
instantiation.

## Signature

```kotlin
object Earth
```

## Properties

The `Earth` object contains the following constant properties:

- `CIRCUMFERENCE_METERS`
    - Type: Double
    - Description: The equatorial circumference of the Earth in meters. Value: `40075016.686`.
- `RADIUS_METERS`
    - Type: Double
    - Description: The equatorial radius of the Earth in meters, as defined by the WGS 84 ellipsoid.
      Value: `6378137.0`.

## Example

This example demonstrates how to access the constants from the `Earth` object.

```kotlin
import com.mapconductor.core.projection.Earth

fun main() {
    val radius = Earth.RADIUS_METERS
    val circumference = Earth.CIRCUMFERENCE_METERS

    println("Earth's Radius: $radius meters")
    println("Earth's Circumference: $circumference meters")
}

// Expected Output:
// Earth's Radius: 6378137.0 meters
// Earth's Circumference: 40075016.686 meters
```
