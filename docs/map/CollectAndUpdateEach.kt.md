# `CollectAndUpdateEach`

`CollectAndUpdateEach` is an internal composable function designed to efficiently observe a
collection of component states. For each state, it listens for changes via a provided `Flow`,
debounces these changes to prevent excessive updates, and then triggers a specified update action.

This utility is particularly useful for scenarios where multiple components on the screen (e.g.,
text fields, sliders) can change rapidly, and you want to batch or delay the corresponding update
operations (like saving to a database or making a network call) until the user has paused their
interaction.

**Note:** This is an `internal` composable and is intended for use within its own module.

## Signature
```kotlin
@OptIn(FlowPreview::class)
@Composable
internal fun <T : ComponentState, FingerPrint> CollectAndUpdateEach(
    states: kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlow<MutableMap<String, T>>,
    debounce: Duration,
    asFlow: (T) -> Flow<FingerPrint>,
    onUpdate: suspend (T) -> Unit,
)
```

## Description
The `CollectAndUpdateEach` composable collects a `StateFlow` map of component states. It iterates
through each state in the map and sets up a `LaunchedEffect` keyed by the state's unique `id`.

Inside the effect, it uses the `asFlow` lambda to get a "fingerprint" flow that signals changes for
that specific state. It then applies a `debounce` period to this flow. When a debounced value is
emitted, the `collectLatest` operator triggers the `onUpdate` suspend function with the
corresponding state. `collectLatest` ensures that if a new change arrives while a previous
`onUpdate` is still running, the old one is canceled and the new one begins, guaranteeing only the
latest state is processed.

## Parameters
- `states`
    - Type: `StateFlow<MutableMap<String, T>>`
    - Description: A `StateFlow` that emits a map of component states. The key is a unique `String`
      identifier, and the value `T` is the component state object.
- `debounce`
    - Type: `Duration`
    - Description: The `kotlin.time.Duration` to wait for after the last change before triggering
      the `onUpdate` action. This helps prevent rapid, successive updates.
- `asFlow`
    - Type: `(T) -> Flow<FingerPrint>`
    - Description: A lambda function that takes a component state `T` and returns a `Flow`. This
      flow is observed for changes. The `FingerPrint` type represents the data that signals a
      change.
- `onUpdate`
    - Type: `suspend (T) -> Unit`
    - Description: A suspendable lambda function that is executed when a debounced change is
      detected. It receives the component state `T` that needs to be updated as its argument.

## Returns
This composable function does not return any value (`Unit`). Its purpose is to manage side effects
by observing state changes and launching update coroutines.

## Example
Imagine you have several text fields on a screen, and you want to automatically save their content
to a server after the user stops typing in any of them.

First, define the state for a single text field.

```kotlin
// A simple base interface required by the generic constraint
interface ComponentState {
    val id: String
}

// State holder for a single text field
data class TextFieldState(
    override val id: String,
    val text: MutableStateFlow<String> = MutableStateFlow("")
) : ComponentState
```

Next, in your ViewModel or state holder, manage a map of these states.

```kotlin
class FormViewModel : ViewModel() {
    private val _formFields = MutableStateFlow<MutableMap<String, TextFieldState>>(
        mutableMapOf(
            "firstName" to TextFieldState(id = "firstName"),
            "lastName" to TextFieldState(id = "lastName")
        )
    )
    val formFields: StateFlow<MutableMap<String, TextFieldState>> = _formFields

    // Simulates saving data to a remote server
    suspend fun saveField(state: TextFieldState) {
        delay(500) // Simulate network latency
        println("Saving field '${state.id}' with value: '${state.text.value}'")
    }
}
```

Finally, use `CollectAndUpdateEach` in your UI to tie everything together.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun UserFormScreen(viewModel: FormViewModel) {
    val fields by viewModel.formFields.collectAsState()

    // This composable will listen for changes in all text fields
    // and trigger the save operation after the user stops typing for 1 second.
    CollectAndUpdateEach(
        states = viewModel.formFields,
        debounce = 1.seconds,
        asFlow = { textFieldState ->
            // For each state, we listen to its text flow for changes.
            // The String itself is the "FingerPrint".
            textFieldState.text
        },
        onUpdate = { textFieldState ->
            // When a debounced change occurs, call the save function.
            viewModel.saveField(textFieldState)
        }
    )

    // UI for displaying the text fields
    Column(modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)) {
        fields.values.forEach { fieldState ->
            val text by fieldState.text.collectAsState()
            OutlinedTextField(
                value = text,
                onValueChange = { newValue -> fieldState.text.value = newValue },
                label = { Text("Enter ${fieldState.id}") },
                modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth().padding(bottom = 8.dp)
            )
        }
    }
}
```
