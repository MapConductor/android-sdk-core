# `LocalPolylineCollector`

A `CompositionLocal` that provides access to a collector for polyline states.

## Signature

```kotlin
val LocalPolylineCollector: ProvidableCompositionLocal<ChildCollector<PolylineState>>
```

## Description

`LocalPolylineCollector` is a `CompositionLocal` used to provide a `ChildCollector<PolylineState>`
down the Composable tree. Its primary purpose is to allow `Polyline` composables to register their
state with the parent `<MapView />`.

It is crucial that any composable utilizing this `CompositionLocal` is a descendant of a `<MapView
/>` component, which is responsible for providing the collector instance. Failure to do so will
result in an `IllegalStateException`.

## Example

The following conceptual example shows how a `Polyline` composable would use
`LocalPolylineCollector` to register its state.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun Polyline(
    // Unique identifier for this polyline
    id: String,
    // Other polyline properties like points, color, etc.
    points: List<LatLng>,
    color: Color,
    width: Float
) {
    // Access the collector from the composition
    val collector = LocalPolylineCollector.current

    // Create the state for this polyline
    val polylineState = remember(id, points, color, width) {
        PolylineState(id = id, points = points, color = color, width = width)
    }

    // Use an effect to register and clean up the polyline state
    DisposableEffect(collector, polylineState) {
        collector.add(polylineState)
        onDispose {
            collector.remove(polylineState)
        }
    }
}
```

## `PolylineOverlay` Class

An overlay class responsible for managing and rendering a collection of polylines on the map.

### Signature

```kotlin
class PolylineOverlay(
    override val flow: StateFlow<MutableMap<String, PolylineState>>,
) : MapOverlayInterface<PolylineState>
```

### Description

`PolylineOverlay` implements the `MapOverlayInterface` to serve as a dedicated layer for polylines.
It observes a `StateFlow` containing the states of all polylines and delegates the rendering task to
a compatible map controller. This class effectively bridges the declarative polyline state with the
underlying map view's rendering engine.

### Constructor Parameters

- `flow`
    - Type: `StateFlow<MutableMap<String, PolylineState>>`
    - Description: A state flow that emits a map of polyline states. The map's key is a unique
      `String` identifier for each polyline, and the value is the `PolylineState` object to be
      rendered.

### Methods

#### `render`

Renders the polylines on the map using a compatible controller.

**Signature**

```kotlin
override suspend fun render(
    data: MutableMap<String, PolylineState>,
    controller: MapViewControllerInterface,
)
```

**Description**

This function is invoked by the map's rendering system. It attempts to cast the provided
`controller` to a `PolylineCapableInterface`. If the cast is successful, it calls the controller's
`compositionPolylines` method, passing the current list of polyline states to be drawn on the map.
If the controller does not implement `PolylineCapableInterface`, no polylines will be rendered by
this overlay.

**Parameters**

- `data`
    - Type: `MutableMap<String, PolylineState>`
    - Description: A map containing the state of all polylines to be rendered in the current frame.
- `controller`
    - Type: `MapViewControllerInterface`
    - Description: The map controller instance. For polylines to be rendered, this controller must
      implement the `PolylineCapableInterface`.

**Returns**

This is a `suspend` function and does not return a value.
